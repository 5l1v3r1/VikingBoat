A package of webcrawlers that crawls websites that publish CVEs, exploits, documents, any king of information related to vulnerabilitys and publish all this information into a page/profile on facebook.

All crawlers are made using Scrapy framework, so you need to check out Scrapy doc to see how works.

OBS: Put the TOKEN of your profile/page on the crawler's code, so the crawler can post in your page (Is comented on the code where you should put the token)
